# Binary Exploitation

## PWN.COLLEGE

https://pwn.college 

Gold standard to learning binary exploitation. Sadly this is 3 semesters worth of work. So we will do an initial phase of our work to:

1) Assembly Crash Course
2) Debugging refresher
3) Shellcode
4) Memory errors
5) Program exploitation

After analysing the speed and how much we can cover during this initial phase, we will decide on what to do from there. Either

1) Extreme fast, we aim for completing everything and getting the blue belt in pwn.college
2) Sadly not as fast as expected, then we can prioritize getting skills up than getting all basics down. Websites like given below we will prioritize common CTF pwn exploits given also below. 
    - https://pwnable.xyz/
    - https://ropemporium.com/index.html
    - ret2libc
    - ret2dlresolve
    - double free, UAF
    - tcachepoisining

## End challenge

Before you come back to college, you are expected to create and submit a CTF challenge in the domain you have taken interest. Solving challenges and creating challenges are completely different so once you select the domain you want to make your challenge in you need to research the resources required to make it. Ofcourse you can ask for help or even collaborate with someone if you want. This will become a template or get included as your submission for 

The challenge if needed an instance needs to be run on docker.
