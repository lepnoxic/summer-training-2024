# Reverse Engineering Training

## Initial tasks

These tasks are extemely important as basics of your reverse engineering. Top priority. 

1) Basics: https://pwn.college/program-security/reverse-engineering (Level 1.0 - 11.1)
2) Z3: https://github.com/ViRb3/z3-python-ctf
3) Angr: https://github.com/Hustcw/Angr_Tutorial_For_CTF/

Deadline: 01st June

## Sub-Sub-Domains

Reverse engineering as a domain is very vast. Below are some of the common domains that we would expect you to be familiar. Pick one and go deep into it

1) Do some of the resources you feel fit for yourself. Talk to SM about what you are planning to do.
2) Once you have done some resources feel free to checkout out other things or finish the rest. It is your decision of what you think gets you trained in that specific domain.
3) Keep logging and sharing what you find to your SM during meets.

Deadline: June 30th with frequent meetings to check progress

### Malware analysis and Deobfuscation (TBD)
i don't know if i want to include this as malware analysis comes from the above two domains aswell and learning deobfuscation directly is not also easy
1) C# Static Deobfuscation: TBD
2) JS Deobfuscation: https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/41

Some tools like
Ghidra extensions: https://github.com/AllsafeCyberSecurity/awesome-ghidra


## End challenge

Before you come back to college, you are expected to create and submit a CTF challenge in the domain you have taken interest. Solving challenges and creating challenges are completely different so once you select the domain you want to make your challenge in you need to research the resources required to make it. Ofcourse you can ask for help or even collaborate with someone if you want. This will become a template or get included as your submission for 

The challenge if needed an instance needs to be run on docker.
